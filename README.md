# Mental-Health-Status-Classification-using-Long-Short-Term-Memory--LSTM--and-Bidirectional-LSTM

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project focuses on **classifying mental health statuses** of individuals based on their textual statements into one of seven categories:  

- Normal  
- Depression  
- Suicidal  
- Anxiety  
- Stress  
- Bi-Polar  
- Personality Disorder  

By leveraging **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Deep Learning** techniques, this project aims to provide insights into mental health research and contribute towards developing intelligent systems such as **early-detection chatbots** and **mental health support tools**.
